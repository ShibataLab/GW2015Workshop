title: Learning Shibata-lab's Motion Capture and EMG System
---

This page lists the activities for Day 2 of this workshop:
 * Morning: 10:00 - 12:00 
	- Introduction to MAC3D motion capture and Evart Software
	- Calibration 
	- Creating a marker model and template 
	- Introduction to EMG
	- EMG Preparation
	- Record motion and EMG of a simple reaching task (5 trials)
	-- Students must form groups of two, and each group will take turns using and recording their own data. 
	
 * Afternoon: 13:00 - 15:00 
	- Exercises in Matlab 
	- Basic signal processing for Motion and EMG data
	- Exporting the CSV data in Matlab
	- Compute for end-effector position, velocity and acceleration profile
	- Process EMG: rectification, moving-average, low-pass filtering
	
 *Optional: create Evart SDK client for streaming motion capture and EMG data (requirement: knowledge in C++).
